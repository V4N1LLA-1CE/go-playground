# Go Playground üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to my **Go Playground**! This repository is where I experiment and learn Go by writing small code snippets, exploring key concepts, and improving my understanding of the language.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository will contain mini programs and snippets

- **Pointers**: Understanding memory addresses and how to manipulate values directly.
- **Idiomatic Go**: Writing clean, efficient, and idiomatic Go code.
- **Interfaces**: Leveraging Go's powerful type system and dynamic interfaces.
- **Concurrency**: Exploring Goroutines and channels to write concurrent programs.

## Purpose

This repository is primarily for educational purposes. Feel free to explore, fork, or clone to see how certain Go features work in practice.
